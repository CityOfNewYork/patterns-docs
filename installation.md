## Getting Started

There are three main methods of installation. The preferred method is to use [NPM (Node Package Manager)](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the source in the **node_modules/** directory of your poject so that you can compile custom stylesheets, JavaScript, and SVGs for your application. This method helps maintain a link with the {{ this.package.nice }} source.

The other two options involve using distributed stylesheets and scripts via a public CDN to pull in files into the page using `<link>` and `<script>` tags or downloading a copy of the package from GitHub to include the package in the project source.

## NPM Install

    $ npm install {{ this.package.name }}

## CDN

Compiled styles and scripts in the **/dist** folder of the GitHub repository can be imported on the page using a CDN such as [JsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com). The following global stylesheet link can be copied and pasted into the the `<head>` of your html document.

```html
<link href="{{ this.package.cdn.url }}@v{{ this.package.version }}{{ this.package.cdn.styles }}" rel="stylesheet">
```

The following global script source can copied and pasted before the closing `</body>` tag of your html document.

```html
<script src="{{ this.package.cdn.url }}@v{{ this.package.version }}{{ this.package.cdn.scripts }}"></script>
```

With the script integrated, SVG icons can be added with the following snippet.

```html
<script>
  var patterns = new {{ this.package.instantiations.scripts }}();

  patterns.icons('{{ this.package.cdn.url }}@v{{ this.package.version }}{{ this.package.cdn.svg }}');
</script>
```

The following url is the base url for all distributed files available via a CDN.

```
{{ this.package.cdn.url }}@v{{ this.package.version }}/dist/
```

<a href="{{ this.package.cdn.source }}/tree/v{{ this.package.version }}/dist/">Visit the GitHub repository to browse all available files</a>. All Patterns are distributed with their own styles and script dependencies in the **/dist** folder. For example, all of the "Accordion" dependencies would live in the **/dist/components/accordion** folder.

There are regular releases to the patterns which follow semantic versioning. You can keep up-to-date with [new releases on each repository's releases page](https://help.github.com/en/github/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github/watching-and-unwatching-releases-for-a-repository).

## Download

You may also download an archive of the repository to include in your project; <a href="{{ this.package.cdn.archive }}/v{{ this.package.version }}.zip">Download v{{ this.package.version }}.zip</a>

## Usage

### Sass

Sass stylesheets for any pattern can be imported into a project from the source directory.

    @use '{{ this.package.name }}/src/components/accordion/accordion';

#### Specificity

The majority of patterns share the same filename for the Sass and JavaScript (if a pattern uses JavaScript). It may be necessary to specify that you need to import the Sass file for [React](https://reactjs.org/) (or other) applications.

    @use '{{ this.package.name }}/src/components/accordion/_accordion.scss';

#### Tailwindcss

Importing Tailwindcss is an exception because it is compiled to a Sass file in the _dist_ directory...

    @use 'node_modules/{{ this.package.name }}{{ this.package.cdn.tailwindsass }}';

... and a CSS file in the distribution folder:

    <link href="{{ this.package.cdn.url }}@v{{ this.package.version }}{{ this.package.cdn.tailwindcss }}" rel="stylesheet">

#### Asset Paths and CDN

The styles use the `url()` for loading webfonts, images, and svgs. By default, it is set to look for asset directories one directory up from the distributed stylesheet so the directory structure of your application is expected to look like so:

    styles/site-default.scss
    images/..
    fonts/..
    svg/..

However, you can set the path to a different path that includes all of these files using the `$cdn` variable.

    // $cdn: '../'; (default)
    $cdn: 'path/to/assets/';

This variable should be placed above all of your imports of the pattern Sass files. The CDN can be set to another local path (such as an absolute path), or, it can be set to the remote url within the `$tokens` map. This default uses [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) to pull the assets from the patterns GitHub repository and the tag of the installed version. ex;

    @use 'config/tokens';
    $cdn: map-get($tokens, 'cdn');

These are the default paths to the different asset types within the asset folder. Uncomment and set to override their defaults.

    $path-to-fonts: 'fonts/';
    $path-to-images: 'images/';
    $path-to-svg: 'svg/';

This is recommended for [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) projects using the [css-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader) (React Scripts (Create React App) use this loader) because Webpack will try to import the asset into your distributed stylesheet. If you don't want to change the `$cdn` variable it is recommended for to disable the [url / image-set functions handling with a boolean](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader/#boolean).

#### Resolving Paths to Patterns

You can add the string `'node_modules/{{ this.package.name }}/src'` to your "resolve" or "include" paths which will allow you to write the shorthand path;

    @use 'components/accordion/accordion';

or

    @use 'components/accordion/_accordion.scss';

For example; the [LibSass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) `includePaths` option which is array of paths that attempt to resolve your `@use` declarations.

    Sass.render({
        file: './src/scss/default.scss',
        outFile: 'site-default.css',
        includePaths: [
          './node_modules',
          './node_modules/{{ this.package.name }}/src'
        ]
      }, (err, result) => {
        Fs.writeFile(`./dist/styles/default.css`, result.css);
      }
    });

Similar to the the [gulp-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass) `includePaths` option.

    gulp.task('sass', () => {
      return gulp.src('./sass/**/*.scss')
        .pipe(sass.({includePaths: [
          'node_modules',
          'node_modules/{{ this.package.name }}/src'
        ]})).pipe(gulp.dest('./css'));
    });

[LibSass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) and [Dart Sass](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass) also support using the `SASS_PATH` environment variable. This variable is useful when configuring a React Application using [React Scripts (Create React App)](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-sass-stylesheet).

    SASS_PATH=node_modules:node_modules/{{ this.package.name }}/src

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) can be configured with the [resolve > modules](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvemodules) option.

    module.exports = {
      //...
      resolve: {
        modules: [
          './node_modules',
          './node_modules/{{ this.package.name }}/src'
        ]
      }
    };

### Scripts

The JavaScript source is written as ES Modules, and using [Rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org), individual components with JavaScript dependencies are distributed as IFFE functions. Depending on your project, you can import either of these. Below are examples of importing only the accordion component and initializing it.

#### ES Module Import

    import Accordion from 'src/components/accordion/accordion';

    new Accordion();

#### IFFE

    <script src="dist/components/accordion.iffe.js"></script>

    <script type="text/javascript">
      new Accordion();
    </script>

**Note** You can also use IFFE modules through the CDN installation method without needing using NPM to install in your project.

#### Global Pattern Script

You may also import the main patterns script with all of the dependencies in it. This script is exported as an IFFE function so it doesn't need to be compiled but you may want to uglify it. Components must be initialized individually.

    <script src="{{ this.package.cdn.scripts }}"></script>

    <script type="text/javascript">
      var patterns = new {{ this.package.instantiations.scripts }}();

      patterns.accordion();
    </script>

The main JavaScript import file in the source will show how each component needs to be initialized if it isn't specified in the pattern's documentation.

## Examples

### Projects

These projects use <a href="#{{ this.marked.headerPrefix }}pattern-libraries">pattern libraries</a> created with the [Patterns CLI](https://github.com/cityofnewyork/patterns-cli) which is how the {{ this.package.nice }} were created. Because of this, they have similar source and distribution structures to use as integration examples. Additionally, they all use NPM to install pattern libraries with slight variations in the asset compilation.
