**Tailwind UI** is a secondary product from the creators of Tailwindcss. It includes some examples of <a href="https://tailwindui.com/components" target="_blank" rel="noindex nofollow">complete components</a> built using the **default** Tailwindcss utility library. For the most part these examples could be built using the {{ this.package.nice }} Tailwindcss implementation. There will be some differences in colors, drop shadows, type, dimensions, etc.
